*Click on the "Data" tab.
*Click on the "Upload" button.
*Choose the kaggle.json file from your local machine and upload it.
*Once you've uploaded the kaggle.json file, you can use it to authenticate and access Kaggle datasets directly in your notebook. Remember not to share your *kaggle.json file or any sensitive information publicly.

-You can view the documentation on the blog and upload your project to your github account.
